  <p>Step 1: Planning <br> I measured my preferred skateboards I've owned and made a <special>schematic</special> of what I'd ideally want in a classic popsicle deck.</p>
  <p>Step 2: Gathering <br> Using bending plys from the Parsons woodshop, I <special>cut them down</special> to be slightly oversized at <special>9" x 34."</special></p>
  <p>Step 3: Printing <br> For the deck art, I decided to silkscreen a <special>graphic</special> onto the wood. I specifically chose to print on the flat plys because it's easier to print on before molding the deck to it's nose and tail shape.</p>
